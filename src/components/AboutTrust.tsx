          q: "Can we create custom onboarding packets or facility-specific requirements?",

          q: "How does the system track compliance and expiring items?",

        },
        {
          q: "Do employers gain automatic access to all provider documents?",
          a: "No. Employers only see what a provider submits or approves for sharing. Providers maintain full control over their vault, and employers cannot access anything outside the shared set."

          q: "Are shared links secure?",

        },
        {
          q: "Can we organize providers by facility, location, or employment type?",
          a: "Yes. Anesthesia Connect allows you to structure your provider roster across multiple hospitals, facilities, departments, or provider contracts. This makes compliance and document management organized and scalable."
